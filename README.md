# Install
Script for Arch Linux that installs my dotfiles and packages. This automates the steps after Arch Linux installation for [devex](https://github.com/enajork/devex). One single command without needing to install git, any other dependencies, or clone this repo:

```sh
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enajork/install_dotfiles/main/run.sh | bash
```
